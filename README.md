# Inspector's Inspector

<sub>*Be the Inspector and inspect your democracy-dealing teammates (or, alternatively, yourself)!*</sub>
## What does it do?

Nothing very special, really. It just takes your after-match stats and gives you a rating accordingly.
## That's it?

Uhh... kinda. I want to add other things like four or less calculators all at once, so you can calculate each teammate individually, and the combined teamwork rating as well. I also have plans on changing how things look, but I doubt you care much :I
I'd also like to add "roles," where, depending on what you did, you'd get a role for it. Let's say you used more than sixteen stims, then I'd call you an "Addict."
## Why upload this here?

Mainly because I wanted somewhere to host this silly thing, so that I can whip out my phone and, hopefully, calculate my efficiency. It's also just a little project I wanted to do, nothing more, nothin' less.
## Minor Disclaimer:

This is my first time actually doing something with HTML/JavaScript, so it's probably really messy underneath the hood and all. I'd also like to say that I, truthfully, didn't really "code" this :/
As you might've guessed, I had ChatGPT help me through most of it, but the ideas behind the math and stuff are all mine, not like it's very special or anything. I have learned a great bit, though, and I'm hoping to update this to have some extra features, which I want to challenge myself by not having help from AI, or at least having it not code for me.
